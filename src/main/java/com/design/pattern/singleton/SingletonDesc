						You initiate the class at the time of class loading. Its drawback is that class is always initialized whether it is being used or not.
						
	# it can be done using static block


Lazy initialization : In this method, class in initialized only when it is required. It can save you from instantiating the class when you don’t need it.
					  Generally lazy initialization is used when we create a singleton class.
